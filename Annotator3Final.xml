<TEXT><![CDATA[According to an American member of the Nixon party , the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials .

They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 .
In fact , `` the market has always tanked .
The last time 0 the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % *T*-1 was in the summer of 1987 .
Still , some market analysts say 0 the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been *?* in years past .
So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says 0 *T*-1 .
What *T*-234 will happen to dividend growth next year ?
Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected *-142 by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .
